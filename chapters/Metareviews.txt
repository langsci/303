\begin{enumerate}
\item Survey:
\item Withdrawn
\\item Chronological changes subword
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Not much addition to the LChange paper (\url{https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W19-4717/})
        \item All three reviewers are positive
        \item A lot of copy-editing is required
    \end{itemize}
\item broadening of harm-related concepts:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Serious addition to the LChange paper (\url{https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W19-4704/})
        \item Two reviewers (one of which Simon) are very positive, one less so
        \item Nothing unfixable for a camera-ready
    \end{itemize}
\item the evolution of circular economy
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Generally positive reviews, though with some complaints about unclear novelty
        \item Related work needs to be extended
        \item Several stylistic or grammar issues than needs addressing
        \item Compared tot he workshop paper they added enough new content
    \end{itemize}
\item  Chaining Algorithms
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Positive reviews in general and well-written paper
        \item Two reviewers mentioned the need to cite own paper from the 2020 Cognitive Science conference, and to discuss novel points (it seems thaty less than 50% of new content is in the chapter..). 
        \item Some questions about method/experiment details and explanations that need to be clarified
        \item More explanation needed about the actual metric used for evaluating results (avg. R-Precision?)
    \end{itemize}
\item  Cross-lingual laws 
\begin{itemize}
\item Still waiting for last two reviews
\end{itemize}
\item Diachronic linguistic periodization 
\begin{itemize}
\item Some minor work, but the reviews are good and the paper novel.
\end{itemize}
\item  Ancient Greek and Latin	
\begin{itemize}
\item The chapter has enough new material in it compared to the WS paper.
\item One review is missing
\item Both the other two reviewers (one is Lars) are positive, but they find the presentation unnecessarily opaque in places
\item My impression is that this is in part an effect of too zealous removal of material from the WS paper in order not to end up on the wrong side of 50\%. 
\item Also, the description of linguistic matters in the chapter gives a shallower, less-informed impression than in the WS paper, which is unfortunate, considering the main audience of this publisher.
\end{itemize}
\item Applications. 
\item  Current and future challenges
\begin{itemize}
\item (reminder) Reviewer has sent comments embedded in pdf on Oct 5 in addition to his feedback in softconf
\end{itemize}
